<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Lambda</a> (cloud functions), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a> (file storage), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/">AppSync</a> (realtime GraphQL), and Cognito (auth) are probably the most relevant things to front-end developers. 

There are frameworks that help you deploy to Lambda, like <a href="https://claudiajs.com/">Claudia</a>, <a href="https://ffleet.io/">Functional Fleet</a>, and <a href="https://serverless.com/">Serverless</a>, and <a href="https://arc.codes/">Architect</a>.

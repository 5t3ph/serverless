An in-browser editor for creating and testing cloud functions. They have some [learning curriculum](https://github.com/auth0/webtask-workshop) to get you up to speed with cloud functions.

It used to be a kind of elaborate demonstration of how you could build user-managed cloud functions into your own app via Auth0 Extend, but Auth0 discontinued that product. I'd be a little wary about the future of Webtask, but it sure makes a nice quick way to spin up a cloud function.

['Cloud Functions']
StdLib is based on Function as a Service ("server-less") architecture, popularized by AWS Lambda. You can use StdLib to build modular, scalable APIs for yourself and other developers in minutes without having to manage servers, gateways, domains, write documentation, or build SDKs. They also offer <a href="https://code.xyz/">Code.xyz</a>, and online code editor for working with the APIs.
    
Webtask

['Cloud Functions', 'Basic JSON data store']
An in-browser editor for creating and testing cloud functions. Seems like the nicest experience for this particular job. It\'s kinda of an elaborate demonstration of <a href="https://auth0.com/extend/">Auth0 Extend</a>, which is essentially a
    way to take Webtask and put it in your own app.
